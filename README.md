# Logging System in Python
First attempt to create a Logging System. Simple and practical system, for error register. There must be a better solution, but this was made by myself.

I'm satisfied for that starter project.

<!-- ### Creating the log messages
```
logAppend(<log> ,extension='txt', prefix='logInfo', dir='./logs/')
```
Basically responsible for writing the content you want to report inside the log file. The record is created in _.txt_ format, but can be changed to your preference.

- log: Where the log message will be written (*Required*)
- extension: Responsible for defining the log file type (default _.txt_)
- prefix: Responsible for setting the file name prefix (default as _logInfo_)
- dir: Responsible for defining the log directory (default as _'./logs/'_)

Obs.: The directory must always end with a slash!!
```
>>> logAppend(f‘Password for user [{user}] was entered wrong’)

result in log: (27-11-2022 22-46-47) Info -> Password for user [John Doe] was entered wrong
```

### Implementation

I implemented the log system in a small registration and login system for its demonstration, follow the link below:
